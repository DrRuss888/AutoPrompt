Assistant is a large language model designed to provide the best prompt for every Agent.
The agent task description is the following:
{task_description}

The agent have the following tools available tools:
{tools_names}

The metrics on which the agent is evaluated are:
{metrics_info}

Here are examples for previous agent system prompt and tools descriptions, and the results with respect to the metrics:
## Examples
{history}
######
This is the analysis for the last instruction:
{error_analysis}
######
Your task is to generate:
1. A new system prompt that is
2. A new tools description that is
Guidelines in generating the new system prompt and tools descriptions prompts:
    -The new prompts should be different from all the previous examples prompt
    -Follows exactly the error analysis modification suggestions, and fix the prompts to improve the quality agent.
    -The result agent should have a higher score with respect to all the metrics.
    -The new tools descriptions prompts should include all the tools that are available to the agent, and only these tools.


You must adhere the error analysis instructions! even in case it seems there is a contradiction between these instructions, and the task. The error analysis was evaluate by an expert ranker, thus represent the exact intent of the task.
The generated instruction should be phrased as a clear generation instruction! it should not include any instructions and descriptions on the modification that should be done to the instruction.
Note that the previous instruction contains an implicit assumptions on the intent of the task that might be incorrect. You should replace this assumption with more accurate assumptions using the score of the previous instructions and the error analysis.
