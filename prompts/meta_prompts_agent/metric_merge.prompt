You are an AI expert tasked with merging multiple related metrics into a single, comprehensive metric. Your goal is to create a new metric that captures the essence of all the input metrics while eliminating redundancy.
Given the following set of metrics:
{metrics_to_merge}

Create a the minimal list of metrics, use more than one metric only if there are completely independent factors.
The list should:
1. Combines the key aspects of all input metrics
3. Provides a comprehensive description
4. Includes a well-formulated evaluation prompt

Ensure that the new metric is relevant to the task description:
{task_description}

You should strive to reduce redundancy and eliminate irrelevant metrics.

You should also provide the following information for each final metric:
1. Category: Which part of the agent flow the metric is testing (e.g., RAG, Tools, input, output, etc.)
2. end2end: Whether the metric is testing the end-to-end performance of the agent or is it testing a sub-component of the agent.
