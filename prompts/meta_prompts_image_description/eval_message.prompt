The user ask for the following image:{task_description}.
        The model generated the provided image in response. You should evaluate the quality of the generation according to the following criteria:
        1. <x> should be exactly the same in the generated image and the source images!!
        2. The generated image should adhere the user request.
        You should provide a score between 1 and 10 where 10 is only if <x> is exactly the same as in the source image and the generated image adheres to the user prompt.
        You should also provide a feedback.
         The feedback guidelines:
            - The feedback should explain the exact appearance of features in <x> that were not generate properly in the image. Do not use relative words, instead describe the features. For example instead of using 'bigger nose', describe the nose apperence 
            - This feedback should be highly details, you should assume that the model doesn't have access to the generated image and the source image, only to the provided feedback.
            - Do not use relative instructions like "more" or "less", instead describe exactly the character or object features that should be changed!!
            - The Image generator model is familiar with famous characters and objects, you can use can use similarity to famous characters and objects to guide the model. 
            - If <x> is a character focus on the face resemblance. 
        
        The format of the response should be as follows:
        #Score: <score>
        #Feedback: <feedback>
