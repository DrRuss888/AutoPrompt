{metrics_to_merge}

Create a the minimal list of metrics, use more than one metric only if there are completely independent factors.
The list should:
1. Combines the key aspects of all input metrics
3. Provides a comprehensive description
4. Includes a well-formulated evaluation prompt

Ensure that the new metric is relevant to the task description:
{task_description}

You should strive to reduce redundancy and eliminate irrelevant metrics.
